# New black hole rendering
*September 25, 2024*

Hey!\
How have you been?\
As for me, since the last time, I celebrated my 19th birthday, got really sick, lost my wallet and all my papers, but i'm fine!

Tonight I had a sudden burst of inspiration.\
Inspired by the new redstone torch model, I randomly decided to launch Blockbench and work on a new 3.0 rendering for Gargantua, and here is the result!\
Unlike previous versions, you can turn the camera all around and it will still look just as good!

Now I need to reprogram it with OpenGL... *\*takes an aspirin\**

See ya next time!
