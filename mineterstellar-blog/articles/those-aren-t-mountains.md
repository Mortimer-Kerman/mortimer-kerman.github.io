# Those aren't mountains...
*September 30, 2024*

After landing on Miller's planet, Endurance's crew was confronted to giant waves.

In 1.12, I used to represent thest giant waves as sad blue rectangles in the far background. They were glitched, easy to miss, and certainly unimpressive and not dangerous at all.

These last few days, I decided to completely change that, and I came up with brand new waves!\
These waves are moving, these waves are giant, these waves make players float in them, and above all they follow one another!

And in addition, you can even take a glance to the brand new Gargantua skybox from the last time!

In the future, I plan to make these waves hurt players, chaotically move them around, and maybe even damage blocks!

Stay tuned!
