# Space suits!
*October 6, 2024*

These last few days, I worked on brand new space suits to replace the old 1.12 suit texture!

They come with a lot of features, such as:

Dyeing!

Displayed player names!

Open helmets!


I plan to add more customization features to them, such as customizing the badges on the chestplate and the arms!

Stay tuned!
