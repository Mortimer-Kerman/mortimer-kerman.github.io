Okay.

In order to make sure I don't repeat the errors of 1.12, I decided to regularly update the version of Minecraft that I use to make sure I always stay up to date.\
So, I just updated from 1.21.0 to 1.21.3, and it's carnage.\
A lot of code has been completely redone by Mojang, and now, I have a lot of broken stuff.

The entity rendering? It's taking on water.\
The space suit? I have to redo everything.\
The sky rendering? Nuked, I'm going to have to refactor almost everything.

And the holidays are almost over...

Right now I'm just praying very hard that my black hole rendering isn't too messed up.

Rangers development will have to wait...
